## Introduction
Note: PatternFly React charts live in its own package at [@patternfly/react-charts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@patternfly/react-charts)!

PatternFly React charts are based on the [Apache ECharts](https://echarts.apache.org/) chart library, along with additional functionality, custom components, and theming for PatternFly. This provides a collection of React based components you can use to build PatternFly patterns with consistent markup, styling, and behavior.

## Examples
### Basic

```ts file="./Basic.tsx"

```
